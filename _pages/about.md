Welcome to my academic and professional portfolio. I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University with expertise in resilience engineering, machine learning, and complex systems analysis. I am passionate about advancing critical infrastructure and aerospace applications through innovative research and data-driven solutions.

## About Me

I am dedicated to pushing the boundaries of engineering through cross-functional research that combines theoretical foundations with practical applications. My work focuses on bifurcation analysis, aerial robotics, and AI applications for critical infrastructure and aerospace systems. With 10+ conference and symposium publications, I bring both academic rigor and industry experience to complex engineering challenges.

## Research Interests

My research interests span multiple interconnected areas:
- **Resilience Engineering**: Complex systems analysis and bifurcation theory for critical infrastructure
- **Machine Learning & AI**: Data-driven approaches for aerospace and robotics applications
- **Aerial Robotics**: Bio-inspired design and autonomous systems for civil operations
- **Complex Systems Analysis**: Modeling and simulation of dynamic systems using advanced computational tools
- **Critical Infrastructure**: Risk mitigation strategies and stability optimization

## Professional Experience

I bring a unique combination of academic research excellence and international industry experience. Currently serving as a Graduate Research and Teaching Assistant at ERAU, I lead machine learning and AI initiatives in the BID4R lab while developing course content for advanced engineering courses. My previous experience includes financial analysis roles in Madrid, Spain, and project management positions, providing me with a well-rounded perspective on both technical and business aspects of engineering solutions.

## Technical Expertise

I am proficient in multiple programming languages and analytical tools including Python, MATLAB, SQL, and various cloud computing platforms. My expertise extends to data analytics, simulation modeling, and the application of tools such as AnyLogic and Power BI to deliver data-driven insights for complex engineering problems.

## Education & Continuous Learning

Currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at ERAU (GPA 4.0/4.0), I also hold multiple degrees including an M.S. in Mechanical Engineering from ERAU and dual degrees from ICAI Universidad Pontificia de Comillas in Madrid, Spain. I am committed to lifelong learning and staying current with the latest developments in engineering and technology.
