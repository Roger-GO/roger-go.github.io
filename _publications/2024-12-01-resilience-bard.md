This paper presents the Bifurcation Analysis for Resilience Diagnostics (BARD) framework, a novel approach for evaluating complex system resilience. The framework leverages mathematical bifurcation theory to provide quantitative insights into system behavior under stress conditions.

**Status**: Under Review at INCOSE Systems Engineering Journal

The BARD framework offers:
- Systematic methodology for resilience assessment
- Quantitative metrics for system stability evaluation
- Predictive capabilities for identifying potential failure modes
- Applications across various complex system domains

This work extends previous research on bifurcation analysis applications and provides practical tools for engineers and system designers working with critical infrastructure and complex systems.
