This paper presents a novel approach to ground target tracking using Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) reinforcement learning algorithms. The work addresses challenges in autonomous target tracking for aerial robotics applications.

**Status**: Under Review for AIAA SciTech Forum 2026

Key contributions include:
- Implementation of SAC algorithms for target tracking applications
- Performance evaluation against traditional control methods
- Analysis of learning efficiency and tracking accuracy
- Applications to autonomous aerial vehicle operations

The research demonstrates the potential of modern reinforcement learning techniques to enhance autonomous system capabilities in complex tracking scenarios, with particular relevance to search and rescue operations and surveillance applications.
