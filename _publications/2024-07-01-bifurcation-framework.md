This research presents a novel framework that leverages bifurcation analysis to understand and enhance the resilience of complex systems. The work demonstrates how mathematical bifurcation theory can provide critical insights into system behavior under various stress conditions, particularly relevant for critical infrastructure applications.

The framework developed in this study offers a systematic approach to:
- Identify critical transition points in complex systems
- Analyze system stability and resilience characteristics
- Predict potential failure modes and system vulnerabilities
- Inform design decisions for enhanced system robustness

This work contributes to the growing field of resilience engineering by providing quantitative tools for system analysis and design optimization.
