This research investigates the complex dynamics involved in transitioning from private to public transportation systems using advanced simulation modeling techniques. The study identifies key barriers that impede sustainable system evolution and proposes strategies to overcome these challenges.

Key contributions of this work include:
- Comprehensive simulation model of transportation system transitions
- Identification of critical barriers to sustainable transportation adoption
- Analysis of policy interventions and their effectiveness
- Framework for evaluating system-level changes in transportation infrastructure

The findings provide valuable insights for urban planners, policymakers, and system designers working to promote sustainable transportation solutions. The simulation-based approach offers a powerful tool for understanding complex system behaviors and testing intervention strategies before implementation.
