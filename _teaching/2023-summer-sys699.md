**Role**: Course Designer and Instructor  
**Level**: Graduate  
**Semester**: Summer 2023

## Course Description

Designed and created an original graduate-level course on system dynamics and agent-based modeling of complex systems. This innovative course incorporated examples from my own research to guide student projects in modeling real-world systems.

## Key Innovations

* **Original Course Development**: Created entirely new curriculum for graduate-level complex systems modeling
* **Research Integration**: Incorporated cutting-edge research examples from my own work in the BID4R lab
* **Practical Applications**: Guided students through hands-on projects modeling real-world complex systems
* **Interdisciplinary Approach**: Combined systems engineering principles with advanced modeling techniques

## Learning Outcomes

Students gained expertise in:
* System dynamics modeling principles
* Agent-based modeling methodologies
* Complex systems analysis techniques
* Real-world application of theoretical concepts
* Research-based problem solving approaches

## Teaching Philosophy

This course exemplified my commitment to bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, using my own research experience to provide students with authentic, cutting-edge learning opportunities in complex systems modeling.
